## INTRODUCTION

These lion head drawings were both drawn by my me      
whilst on a visit to the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square.    

I drew them by using my finger:-   
Hardware: **iPad Air 2**  
App: **Zen Brush**      

When the gallery had closed at 6 PM in the evening;         
I decided to go walk around the square for a bit...;  
after staring at the 4 lion sculptures that lie around the square;    
I thought why not have a go at drawing 2.
