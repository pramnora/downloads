## INTRODUCTION

These 2 lion head drawings were both drawn by my me      
whilst on a visit to the National Gallery in London's Trafalgar Square, UK.      

-(**NOTE**: I've always been a fervent art lover all throughout my life...;      
so, will often go and visit seeing the National Gallery, regularly.)-    

I drew them by using my finger:-   
Hardware: **iPad Air 2**  
App: **Zen Brush**      

When the gallery had closed at 6 PM in the evening;         
I decided to go walk around the square for a bit...;    
after staring up at the 4 x magnificent lion sculptures     
that lie around the square;      
I thought why not have a go at drawing two.
