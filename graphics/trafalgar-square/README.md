## INTRODUCTION

These 2 lion head drawings were both drawn by my me      
whilst on a visit to the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, London, UK.      

When the gallery had closed at 6 PM in the evening;         
I decided to go walk around the square for a bit...;    
after staring up at the 4 x magnificent lion sculptures     
that lie around the square;      
I thought why not have a go at drawing two.
