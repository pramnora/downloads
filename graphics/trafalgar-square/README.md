## INTRODUCTION

These 2 lion head drawings were both drawn by my me      
whilst on a visit to the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, London, UK.      

When the gallery had closed down at 6 PM during the evening;           
I decided to go off and walk around the square for a bit...in order to see more.  
    
After staring up at the 4 x magnificent lion sculptures that lie around the square...;       
I thought why not have a go at drawing one or two of these.
