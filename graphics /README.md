## INTRODUCTION

These drawings were produced by my own hand.

I drew them on the iPad Air 2...which on a visit to the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square.  

When the gallery had closed at 6 PM in the evening. I walked around the square for a bit...;  
then, decided why not have a go at drawing 2 of the 4 Trafalgar Square lion sculptures.
