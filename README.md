## INTRODUCTION

I created this 'downloads' repo.,    
with the intention of practicing grabbing repos from off Github.com;    
and, I'm pleased to report that I was able to successfully clone this repo.  

-----

## INSTRUCTIONS  

-----

### ON THE WEB...  

1. Select the Github repository you wish to clone by visiting it's Github URL address:  

- https://github.com/pramnora/downloads/tree/main  

2. Click on the green button: [<> Code]  
3. Make sure HTTPS is selected (default option)  
4. Next, click on Copy URL to clipboard icon.  (copies the URL to clipboard)

-----

### ON YOUR COMPUTER   

1. Open up a Terminal application window: [SHIFT]+[CTRL]+[T]    
2. Type in the command: git clone  
3. Followed by the URL that you wish to clone: (paste/[SHIFT]+[CTRL]+[V])  
4. Finally, click the [ENTER] key...to start cloning...  
5. When the cloning operation reports as 'done';     
   then, that's it the repo has now been fully cloned onto your own home/work computer.  

-----

### ACTUAL CODE  

Here is an actual example of the command I used to clone this repo to my home computer...    
> $ git clone https://github.com/pramnora/downloads.git  

-----

**NOTE(S)**:

-----

a. The dollar symbol: ($) is NOT a part of the command.   
  That just represents the Command prompt symbol which shows inside of Linux Mint Terminal window...;  
  you type in your command after this prompt.   

> $ (command is typed in here)  

-----

b. I'd created a Linode instance computer running Ubuntu...;  
    just to see if cloning GitHub repos would work there, too?  
    Answer: Yes. ;-)    

-(I guess, cloning Github repo's pretty much works the same just about everywhere.)-
