## INTRODUCTION

I created this 'downloads' repo...with the intention of practicing grabbing repos from off Github.com.  

I was successfully able to clone this repo.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### ON THE WEB...  

1. Select the Github repository you wish to clone by visiting it's Github URL address.  
2. Click on the green button: [<> Code]  
3. Make sure HTTPS is selected (default option)  
4. Next, click on Copy URL to clipboard icon.  (copies the URL to clipboard)

-----

### ON YOUR COMPUTER   

1. Open up a Terminal application window  
2. Type in the command: git clone  
3. Followed by the URL that you wish to clone (paste/[SHIFT]+[CTRL]+[V])  
4. Finally, click the [ENTER] key...to start cloning...  
5. When the cloning operation reports as 'done';     
   then, that's it the repo has now been fully cloned onto your own home/work computer.

Here is an actual example of the command I used to clone this repo to my home computer...

*NOTE(S)*:-  

a. I'd created a Linode instance computer running Ubuntu...;  
    just to see if cloning GitHub repos would work there, too?  
    Answer: Yes. ;-)
