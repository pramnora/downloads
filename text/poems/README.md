## Introduction

I *love* reading Shakespeare...who is my most favourite poet ever.    
I read pretty much all of his works.  

I also like collecting Poetry Anthologies...where it's possible to see and read      
though many different poets work...who have lived right throughout the ages...   
ranging from modern to old: Chaucer/Byron/Shelley/-etc.    

Ocassionally, I like to have a go at writing some poetry myself...;    
though, I have to admit I'm **not** very good at it...???  

I would say most of my own poetry is, in fact, straight forwards English *prose*;  
with each line shortened down a bit.  

Anyway, here are some poems that I'm used to reciting entirely *off by heart*.   
I  find it's good to learn poetry off by heart...;  
as, then, one can have that poem to read/and, recite: 24/7/366,  
basically, wherever in the world that it is you are;    
and, also, during whatever activity it is you are doing.  

Sometimes, I like to learn to recite foreign language poetry, too;    
Italian, Spanish, Japanese, -etc.  
which helps me learn the language...be able to practice the accent...;    
as well as, too, reading/writing it.
