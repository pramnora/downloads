# Sonnet No 18

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day,
Thou art more lovely and temperate,
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And, summer's lease hath all too short a date.

Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And, often is his fair complexion dimmed;
And, everything from fair sometimes declines,
by chance or nature's changing course untrimmed.

But, thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou lowest;
Nor shall death brag thou wonderest in his shade,
When in enteral lines to time thou growest.

So long as men live, and, eyes do see;
So, long lives this; and, this gives life to thee.


- William Shakespeare
