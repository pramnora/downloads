Fall leaves fall,  
Die flowers away,  
Lengthen night,  
And, shorten day.  

Every leaf   
Speaks bliss to me,  
Fluttering from   
The Autumn tree.  

I shall smile when wreaths of snow  
Blossom where the rose should grow;  
I shall sing when nights decay  
Ushers in a drearier day.  

- Emily Bronte
